# Overview

This skill defines coding standards and design principles for TypeScript development in this project.

# Naming Conventions

- **All code must use camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, and parameters
- **PascalCase** is reserved for classes, interfaces, types, and enums
- **All code, including variable names, function names, and comments, must be written in English**

# Documentation

- **Every method must have JSDoc comments** including:
  - Description of what the method does
  - `@param` tags with types and descriptions for all parameters
  - `@returns` tag with type and description of the return value
  - `@throws` tag documenting any exceptions the method may throw

Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the total price including tax.
 * @param {number} basePrice - The base price before tax
 * @param {number} taxRate - The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.21 for 21%)
 * @returns {number} The total price including tax
 * @throws {Error} If basePrice or taxRate is negative
 */
function calculateTotalPrice(basePrice: number, taxRate: number): number {
  if (basePrice < 0 || taxRate < 0) {
    throw new Error('Price and tax rate must be non-negative');
  }
  return basePrice * (1 + taxRate);
}
```

# Design Principles

## Avoid Over-Abstraction

- Only abstract when there is a clear, demonstrated need
- Prefer concrete implementations over premature generalization
- Wait until you have at least two or three concrete use cases before creating an abstraction

## Minimize Long-Term Complexity

- **Concentrate internal complexity behind simple, consistent interfaces** - The implementation can be complex, but the API should be intuitive
- **Create deep abstractions that do much with little** - Prefer modules that provide significant functionality through a minimal interface
- **Avoid premature generalizations** - Solve the problem at hand; don't design for hypothetical future requirements
- **Use comments only to explain decisions and reasoning that the code cannot express** - Comments should answer "why", not "what"

## Interface Design

- Keep public interfaces small and focused
- Hide implementation details aggressively
- Make common operations simple and rare operations possible
- Prefer composition over inheritance when the relationship is not strictly "is-a"

# Immutability by Default

- Prefer `const` over `let` whenever possible
- Use `readonly` for properties that should not be mutated after initialization
- Prefer immutable array methods (`.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`) over mutations (`.push()`, `.splice()`)
- When state must change, create new objects/arrays instead of mutating existing ones

# Strict Typing

- **Never use `any`** — use `unknown` when the type is truly unknown, then narrow it
- Enable `strict: true` in tsconfig.json
- Prefer specific types over broad generic types
- Use union types and type guards for runtime type safety
- Define explicit return types for public methods

# Expressive Naming

- Names must reveal intent: `getUserById` instead of `get`, `calculateTotalPrice` instead of `calc`
- Boolean variables and methods should use clear prefixes: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit`, `shouldRetry`
- Avoid cryptic abbreviations: `transaction` instead of `tx`, `configuration` instead of `cfg`
- Collections should be plural: `users`, `orderItems`, `activeConnections`

# Testing

- **Every public method must have corresponding unit tests**
- Tests should cover:
  - Happy path (expected behavior with valid inputs)
  - Edge cases (empty arrays, null values, boundary conditions)
  - Error cases (invalid inputs, expected exceptions)
- Test names should describe the expected behavior: `should return null when user is not found`
- Keep tests independent — each test should set up its own data and not depend on other tests
- Aim for tests that are fast, isolated, and deterministic

# Dependencies

- **Always verify the latest version before installing any package**
- Check npm or the official documentation to ensure you are installing the most recent stable version
- Use `npm info <package> version` or check npmjs.com to confirm the latest version
- Avoid installing outdated packages that may have known vulnerabilities or missing features
